What Happened:

We ran out of time on this project. 
We left off implementing Disk Read/Disk Write to pass test case 03. Clock driver is implemented and functioning correctly.
Couldn't figure out the opr, reg1 and reg2 parameters for the different operations (Disk read vs. Disk write), which 
	prevented us from completing those operations.
